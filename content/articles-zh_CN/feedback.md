Transform feedback
==================

Up until now we've always sent vertex data to the graphics processor and only
produced drawn pixels in framebuffers in return. What if we want to retrieve the
vertices after they've passed through the vertex or geometry shaders? In this
chapter we'll look at a way to do this, known as *transform feedback*.

So far, we've used VBOs (Vertex Buffer Objects) to store vertices to be used for
drawing operations. The transform feedback extension allows shaders to write
vertices back to these as well. You could for example build a vertex shader that
simulates gravity and writes updated vertex positions back to the buffer. This
way you don't have to transfer this data back and forth from graphics memory to
main memory. On top of that, you get to benefit from the vast parallel
processing power of today's GPUs.

Basic feedback
==============

We'll start from scratch so that the final program will clearly demonstrate
how simple transform feedback is. Unfortunately there's no preview this time,
because we're not going to draw anything in this chapter! Although this feature
can be used to simplify effects like particle simulation, explaining these is a
bit beyond the scope of these articles. After you've understood the basics of
transform feedback, you'll be able to find and understand plenty of articles
around the web on these topics.

Let's start with a simple vertex shader.

    const GLchar* vertexShaderSrc = GLSL(
        in float inValue;
        out float outValue;

        void main() {
            outValue = sqrt(inValue);
        }
    );

This vertex shader does not appear to make much sense. It doesn't set a
`gl_Position` and it only takes a single arbitrary float as input. Luckily, we
can use transform feedback to capture the result, as we'll see momentarily.

    GLuint shader = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER);
    glShaderSource(shader, 1, &vertexShaderSrc, nullptr);
    glCompileShader(shader);

    GLuint program = glCreateProgram();
    glAttachShader(program, shader);

Compile the shader, create a program and attach the shader, but don't call
`glLinkProgram` yet! Before linking the program, we have to tell OpenGL which
output attributes we want to capture into a buffer.

    const GLchar* feedbackVaryings[] = { "outValue" };
    glTransformFeedbackVaryings(program, 1, feedbackVaryings, GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS);

The first parameter is self-explanatory, the second and third parameter specify
the length of the output names array and the array itself, and the final
parameter specifies how the data should be written.

The following two formats are available:

- **GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS**: Write all attributes to a single buffer object.
- **GL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS**: Writes attributes to multiple buffer objects or at
different offsets into a buffer.

Sometimes it is useful to have separate buffers for each attribute, but lets
keep it simple for this demo. Now that you've specified the output variables,
you can link and activate the program. That is because the linking process
depends on knowledge about the outputs.

    glLinkProgram(program);
    glUseProgram(program);

After that, create and bind the VAO:

    GLuint vao;
    glGenVertexArrays(1, &vao);
    glBindVertexArray(vao);

Now, create a buffer with some input data for the vertex shader:

    GLfloat data[] = { 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f };

    GLuint vbo;
    glGenBuffers(1, &vbo);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(data), data, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

The numbers in `data` are the numbers we want the shader to calculate the square
root of and transform feedback will help us get the results back.

With regards to vertex pointers, you know the drill by now:

    GLint inputAttrib = glGetAttribLocation(program, "inValue");
    glEnableVertexAttribArray(inputAttrib);
    glVertexAttribPointer(inputAttrib, 1, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, 0);

Transform feedback will return the values of `outValue`, but first we'll need to
create a VBO to hold these, just like the input vertices:

    GLuint tbo;
    glGenBuffers(1, &tbo);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, tbo);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(data), nullptr, GL_STATIC_READ);

Notice that we now pass a `nullptr` to create a buffer big enough to hold all of
the resulting floats, but without specifying any initial data. The appropriate
usage type is now `GL_STATIC_READ`, which indicates that we intend OpenGL to
write to this buffer and our application to read from it. (See [reference](http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glBufferData.xml) for usage types)

We've now made all preparations for the <del>rendering</del> computation
process. As we don't intend to draw anything, the rasterizer should be disabled:

    glEnable(GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD);

To actually bind the buffer we've created above as transform feedback buffer,
we have to use a new function called `glBindBufferBase`.

    glBindBufferBase(GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, 0, tbo);

The first parameter is currently required to be `GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER`
to allow for future extensions. The second parameter is the index of the output
variable, which is simply `0` because we only have one. The final parameter
specifies the buffer object to bind.

Before doing the draw call, you have to enter transform feedback mode:

    glBeginTransformFeedback(GL_POINTS);

It certainly brings back memories of the old `glBegin` days! Just like the
geometry shader in the last chapter, the possible values for the primitive mode
are a bit more limited.

- `GL_POINTS` &mdash; `GL_POINTS`
- `GL_LINES` &mdash; `GL_LINES, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINES_ADJACENCY, GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY`
- `GL_TRIANGLES` &mdash; `GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY`

If you only have a vertex shader, as we do now, the primitive *must* match the
one being drawn:

    glDrawArrays(GL_POINTS, 0, 5);

Even though we're now working with data, the single numbers can still be seen as
separate "points", so we use that primitive mode.

End the transform feedback mode:

    glEndTransformFeedback();

Normally, at the end of a drawing operation, we'd swap the buffers to present
the result on the screen. We still want to make sure the rendering operation has
finished before trying to access the results, so we flush OpenGL's command
buffer:

    glFlush();

Getting the results back is now as easy as copying the buffer data back to an
array:

    GLfloat feedback[5];
    glGetBufferSubData(GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, 0, sizeof(feedback), feedback);

If you now print the values in the array, you should see the square roots of the
input in your terminal:

    printf("%f %f %f %f %f\n", feedback[0], feedback[1], feedback[2], feedback[3], feedback[4]);

Congratulations, you now know how to make your GPU perform general purpose
tasks with vertex shaders! Of course a real GPGPU framework like [OpenCL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL)
is generally better at this, but the advantage of transform feedback is that you
can directly repurpose the data in drawing operations, by for example binding
the transform feedback buffer as array buffer and performing normal drawing
calls.

If you have a graphics card and driver that supports it, you could also use
[compute shaders](http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Compute_Shader) in OpenGL 4.3
instead, which were actually designed for tasks that are less related to drawing.

You can find the full code [here](/content/code/c8_basic.txt).

Feedback transform and geometry shaders
=======================================

When you include a geometry shader, the transform feedback operation will
capture the outputs of the geometry shader instead of the vertex shader. For
example:

    // Vertex shader
    const GLchar* vertexShaderSrc = GLSL(
        in float inValue;
        out float geoValue;

        void main() {
            geoValue = sqrt(inValue);
        }
    );

    // Geometry shader
    const GLchar* geoShaderSrc = GLSL(
        layout(points) in;
        layout(triangle_strip, max_vertices = 3) out;

        in float[] geoValue;
        out float outValue;

        void main() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                outValue = geoValue[0] + i;
                EmitVertex();
            }

            EndPrimitive();
        }
    );

The geometry shader takes a point processed by the vertex shader and generates
2 more to form a triangle with each point having a 1 higher value.

    GLuint geoShader = glCreateShader(GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER);
    glShaderSource(geoShader, 1, &geoShaderSrc, nullptr);
    glCompileShader(geoShader);

    ...

    glAttachShader(program, geoShader);

Compile and attach the geometry shader to the program to start using it.

    const GLchar* feedbackVaryings[] = { "outValue" };
    glTransformFeedbackVaryings(program, 1, feedbackVaryings, GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS);

Although the output is now coming from the geometry shader, we've not changed
the name, so this code remains unchanged.

Because each input vertex will generate 3 vertices as output, the transform
feedback buffer now needs to be 3 times as big as the input buffer:

    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(data) * 3, nullptr, GL_STATIC_READ);

When using a geometry shader, the primitive specified to
`glBeginTransformFeedback` must match the output type of the geometry shader:

    glBeginTransformFeedback(GL_TRIANGLES);

Retrieving the output still works the same:

    // Fetch and print results
    GLfloat feedback[15];
    glGetBufferSubData(GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, 0, sizeof(feedback), feedback);

    for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
        printf("%f\n", feedback[i]);
    }

<img src="/media/img/c8_geometry.png" alt="Basic geometry shader result" />

Although you have to pay attention to the feedback primitive type and the size
of your buffers, adding a geometry shader to the equation doesn't change much
other than the shader responsible for output.

The full code can be found [here](/content/code/c8_geometry.txt).

Variable feedback
=================

As we've seen in the previous chapter, geometry shaders have the unique property
to generate a variable amount of data. Luckily, there are ways to keep track of
how many primitives were written by using *query objects*.

Just like all the other objects in OpenGL, you'll have to create one first:

    GLuint query;
    glGenQueries(1, &query);

Then, right before calling `glBeginTransformFeedback`, you have to tell OpenGL
to keep track of the number of primitives written:

    glBeginQuery(GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN, query);

After `glEndTransformFeedback`, you can stop "recording":

    glEndQuery(GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN);

Retrieving the result is done as follows:

    GLuint primitives;
    glGetQueryObjectuiv(query, GL_QUERY_RESULT, &primitives);

You can then print that value along with the other data:

    printf("%u primitives written!\n\n", primitives);

<img src="/media/img/c8_query.png" alt="Query result" />

Notice that it returns the number of primitives, not the number of vertices.
Since we have 15 vertices, with each triangle having 3, we have 5 primitives.

Query objects can also be used to record things such as `GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED`
when dealing with just geometry shaders and `GL_TIME_ELAPSED` to measure time
spent on the server (graphics card) doing work.

See [the full code](/content/code/c8_final.txt) if you got stuck somewhere on the way.

Conclusion
==========

You now know enough about geometry shaders and transform feedback to make your
graphics card do some very interesting work besides just drawing! You can even
combine transform feedback and rasterization to update vertices and draw them
at the same time!
